== Description ==

Extend Woocoomerce feature easily with this plugin.

The product like buttons and the total likes for each product are prominently displayed on the product page as well as on each product in the archive page, such as the product category page. This allows users to easily see and interact with the like feature.

In the My Account page, there is an option to enable or disable the display of a list containing all the products that the user has liked. This provides users with a convenient way to view their liked products in one place.

The product page has a comment section enabled, allowing users to leave comments and feedback about the product. This promotes engagement and interaction between customers and the store.

A new option has been added to show the like option on both the single product page and shop pages. This means that users can like products directly from these pages without having to navigate to the individual product page.

The text on the Add to Cart button has been customized or changed according to specific requirements. This allows store owners to use their preferred terminology or call-to-action on the button.

Similarly, the text on the Checkout Order button has been customized or changed. This gives the store owner the flexibility to use a specific text that aligns with their branding or conveys a desired message.

The add to cart feature has been completely removed from the store. This means that customers can no longer add products to a cart for later purchase. The store may have implemented an alternative purchasing process or requires customers to make immediate purchases.

The product price is hidden for users who are not logged in across the entire store. This may be done to encourage users to create an account or login to view the pricing information. This strategy can be useful for stores that want to provide exclusive pricing or incentives to registered users.

The Woocommerce add to cart button now redirects users directly to the checkout page upon clicking. This streamlines the purchasing process and reduces the number of steps required for customers to complete their transactions.
